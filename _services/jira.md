Core Bioinformatics manages a **ticketing system**.

The platform requires a login with your Quadram credentials (Single Sign-On). Note that the system requires you to log in with your `name.surname@quadram.ac.uk` email address, and then use the NBI Single Sign On (SSO) authentication using your `username@nbi.ac.uk` address.
