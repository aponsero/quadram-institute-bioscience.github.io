[IRIDA](https://www.irida.ca/) (Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis) is a user-friendly,
open source bioinformatics platform designed to support real-time outbreak investigations and general infectious disease genomics using whole genome sequencing data  ([read more](https://irida.ca/platform-overview/platform-overview.html)). 

It offers end-to-end management of genomic data, high-performance computing, visualizations, and secure data sharing across its distributed network. IRIDA is suitable for public health, food safety, and clinical microbiology sectors and is geared towards making sophisticated genomic analyses accessible to laboratory personnel.

## Sequencing output management

The primary use of IRIDA is to provide a central repository for the secure and future-proof storage of sequencing data. It can handle data from a variety of sequencing platforms and technologies, including Illumina, Ion Torrent, and Oxford Nanopore.

## IRIDA at the Quadram Institute

We integrated IRIDA in our platform:

* **Single-sign on (SSO)**: Quadram users can login with their e-mail account 
* Data export to [**Galaxy**]({{ % _link galaxy.md % }}) instance, allowing users to seamlessly transfer data between the two platforms.
