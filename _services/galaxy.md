The **Galaxy Project** is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research in the life sciences. 
It enables users to perform complex data analyses and share their workflows and results, all without needing to install software or hardware. Galaxy supports a wide range of biological data, including genomics, proteomics, and high-throughput imaging, and aims to empower scientists who do not have computer programming experience, facilitating data-driven research across the globe.
